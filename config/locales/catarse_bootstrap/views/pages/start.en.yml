The secret is to have a good planning! We can help you! <a href=\"#start-form\"> Just get your project started. </a> '

            question: 'Do I need to reach the goal to get my money?'
            answer: 'We currently use the model "all or nothing", you only keep the money if you reach the goal in the time stipulated by you. If the project does not reach the revenue target, we will fully return the money to its supporters, at no cost to you or who supported you. The "all or nothing" is extremely efficient because, in addition to campaigns securing more money, it is one way we can ensure that a project will only happen if it can be delivered as described and promised to the supporters. <br> However we are building a flexible form of crowdfunding for Startio, affectionately called Startio Flex. It will be different from all forms of flexible campaigns that exist in the market. In Startio Flex you get all the money, independently of reaching the target or not. This mode is not yet open to the general public, but you can discover more at <a href="https://www.Startio.me/flex"> www.Startio.me/flex </a>'
          2:
            question: 'What are your rates?'
            answer: 'We charge 13% of the total value of projects that have reached or exceeded the target of your crowdfunding campaign. We get about 9% and 4% is passed on to "Pagar.me", the payment method used in Startio. Projects using the "all or nothing" crowdfunding mode, and those that did not reach the target in the campaign time have no cost and all supporters receive the money back.'
          3:
            question: 'Where does the money comes from?'
            answer: 'Family, friends, fans and community members are you major contributors. Use your network, grab support and promote the project. Supporters promote and recommend your campaign to other people they know, and so the circle of supporters grows further. The secret is to build a good project, to plan your campaign and to direct the efforts of those who are actually interested in what you are proposing in your crowdfunding campaign.'
