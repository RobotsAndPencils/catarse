b Do you want more information?
br
b Because I have money in Startio?
br
p At some point in the last five years you supported crowdfunding projects / collective funding Startio which unfortunately did not reach the goal. How we use the all-or-nothing method, if the project does not hit the goal everyone is entitled to receive the money back supported. Some people did not receive these returns, or because the card used was locked at the time of return, or because they did not meet the bank details to realize the return.

b What happens if I do not make this decision?
br
p On July 11, 2015 we held a change in our Terms of Use which provides that if we can not contact you through the registration data registered on our platform and we lack any banking information to make the refund within the period 12 months after the project closing date values will be considered waived and may be used by Startio to reinvest the platform and benefit the community. If you do not decide after 30 days of sending the first notification, the credit amounts will be considered waived.

b Because I have to make that decision within 30 days?
br
p We set the deadline of 30 days from the first notification to be sure that you will see this message and make that decision. Think with enough love and affection! We need your answer so we can make a more accurate and transparent financial planning.

b Can I use my credits to support another project?
br
p From the 10.11.2014 it is no longer possible to use the Startio credits to support projects on the platform. This is one of the changes we made to simplify the payment process and ensure repayments for everyone. Clicking on "I want to donate to Startio" you support the platform's operations directly, helping us to spread further the collective financing by Brazil.

b Have more questions?

p If you have any questions please contact us by replying to this email or by #{mail_to CatarseSettings[:email_contact]}
